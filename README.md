# AutoSave
AutoSave is a mod for __Green Hell__ that will automatically save game every 10 minutes.

__This mod will only work if you are the host, or if you are in singleplayer mode.__

- You can switch the feature OFF or ON at runtime by using a shortcut (__NumPad7__ by default).
- You can change save frequency in seconds inside the file "__[...]/steamapps/common/Green Hell/Mods/AutoSave.txt__" (note that you need to run this mod once for this file to be created).

You can contact me on Discord if needed (*OSubMarin#0460*).
